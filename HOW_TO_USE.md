# How to Customize Your CV

This guide will help you modify the content of your CV without any coding knowledge. All you need is a text editor (like Notepad, TextEdit, or VS Code) and basic knowledge of Markdown formatting.

2. `education.md` - Your educational background
3. `experience.md` - Your work experience
4. `skills.md` - Your technical and soft skills
5. `publications.md` - Your publications or written works
6. `research.md` - Your research experience or projects
7. `teaching.md` - Your teaching experience and courses
8. `talks.md` - Your presentations and speaking engagements

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Edit Files

### Basic Markdown Formatting Guide

Markdown is a simple way to format text. Here are the basics:

- For **bold text** use: `**text**`
- For *italic text* use: `*text*`
- For bullet points, start a line with `-` or `*`
- For numbered lists, start lines with `1.`, `2.`, etc.
- For headings, use `#`:
  - `# Main Heading`
  - `## Subheading`
  - `### Smaller heading`
